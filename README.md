A fast, purely deterministic solver for a subset of 3SAT problems. 
This algorithm uses frequency-based greedy variable assignment to find satisfying solutions in polynomial time. 
While it cannot solve all 3SAT problems (NP-complete), it performs impressively well on under-constrained or imbalanced instances.
It can solve most problems in milliseconds.
